## Excel Dashboard for Product Review using PivotTables and Formulas 

My name is Ogunbadejo Olukemi, and I am a student in The Incubator Hub's Digital Skill Africa training program, where I am studying Data Analysis. I have undergone extensive training in Excel, SQL, and Power BI, guided by knowledgeable instructors in Data Analytics and Data Engineering. I want to express my gratitude to my expert tutors: Mr. Muhsin I., Mr. Femi, and Mr. Temidayo.

## Tools Used
 - Excel Formulas
 - Pivot Tables.
 - Charts (Column bar charts and Clustered bar charts)
 - Slicers
## Outcome
- Observations:
    1. From the Rating to Discount chart, Products with moderate ratings (1-3) received the highest discount of 67%
    2. High-rated Products received (1-5) received less discount of 48% than even low-rated ones
- Concerns:
     High-rated Products (1-5) that are likely to receive the most satisfaction are receiving lower discounts than others, which may lead to dissatisfaction.
- Recommendations:
    1. Offer better incentives to high-rated products to retain and  upsell them
    2. Understand why mid-rated products are getting more discounts. Are they more price-sensitive, or is this a reaction to poor discounts?
