## Excel Dashboard for Product Review using PivotTables and Formulas 

My name is Ogunbadejo Olukemi, and I am a student in The Incubator Hub's Digital Skill Africa training program, where I am studying Data Analysis. I have undergone extensive training in Excel, SQL, and Power BI, guided by knowledgeable instructors in Data Analytics and Data Engineering. I want to express my gratitude to my expert tutors: Mr. Muhsin I., Mr. Femi, and Mr. Temidayo.
### Project Instruction:
 The task involved selecting 2 out of the 3 case studies provided for the project and conducting a thorough Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA) using appropriate analytical tools and techniques.
 ## Project Topic: Amazon Product Review Analysis

## Objectives
 - Structured Dataset which contains
    1. Product Details: Name, Category, Discount, and Ratings.
    2. Customer Engagement: User Reviews, titles, and Contents
  - Use PivotTables to summarise
     1. Category by Ratings
     2. Category by Product
     3. Category by Review
     4. Category by Discount Percentage
     5. Category by Discounted Price and Actual Price

 - Dataset: Contains the Original data and cleaned Excel data
 - Charts: Screenshot of Visualization
## Visuals  


## Tools Used
 - Excel Formulas
 - Pivot Tables.
 - Charts (Column bar charts and Clustered bar charts)
 - Slicers
## Outcome
- Observations:
    1. From the Rating to Discount chart, Product with moderate ratings (1-3) received highest discount of 67%
    2. High rated Products received (1-5) received less discount of 48% than even low rated ones
- Concerns:
     High rated Products (1-5) that are likely the most satisfied are receiving lower discount than others, this may lead to dissatisfaction.
- Recommendations:
    1. Offer better incentives to high rated product to retain and  upsell them
    2. Understand why mid rated product are getting more discounts. Are they more price sensitive or is this a reactive to poor discount.
